"""
test_privacy_baseline.py — Baseline privacy measurements for standard MeshCore routing.

These tests QUANTIFY the privacy exposure of the current protocol and are
EXPECTED TO PASS — they document the attack surface, not a solution.  When a
privacy-preserving protocol is later implemented, its measurements will be
compared against these baselines in a separate test module.

Metrics established here:
  1. Flood witness count      — how many (sender→receiver) pairs observe a message
  2. Fingerprint stability    — the encrypted payload is identical at every hop,
                                enabling cross-node correlation
  3. Path-count proximity     — the relay-hash counter in the packet header
                                increases with each hop, leaking distance to source
  4. Collusion gain           — what K passive relay observers can collectively infer
  5. Direct routing reduction — how much witness_count shrinks after path exchange

Topology: 3×3 grid (9 nodes), zero link loss.
  SOURCE   = n_0_0  (endpoint)
  DEST     = n_2_2  (endpoint)
  RELAYS   = all 7 interior nodes
