Moving away from this approach - as it is TOO slow, soon a full C++ implementation to be presented - with different approach.

# meshcore_sim

Fork from wonderfull job of Matthew - [Original Reop](https://github.com/matthewdgreen/meshcore_sim) 
focused on **realistic timing and collision modelling** 

I put attention to make radio as much realistic as possible - through - 
- SF-aware simulation
- Half-duplex corrections - collision detection
- Band-width aware
- Missing ACK and PATH
- More realistic timing and collision detection
- Node binary connected to simulated radio in missing touch points (e.g. missing retry, duty cycle, tx airtime.
- Listen before TX
- Realistic Advert
- SNR reception model implemented (in topology we define SNR; RSSI is derived as SNR + noise_floor)
- ...
More details in attached documentation.

A simulator for [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) mesh
networks.  Each simulated node runs the **real MeshCore C++ routing and
cryptography code** as a standalone subprocess; a Python orchestrator connects
them over simulated radio links with configurable loss, latency, SNR,
RF collisions, and adversarial behaviour.

```
alice ──(loss 5%, 20 ms)── relay1 ──(loss 5%, 20 ms)── bob
```
```
$ python3 -m orchestrator topologies/linear_three.json --duration 30 --seed 42
…
  Message delivery: 4/4 (100.0%)
  Latency (send->recv): min=21ms  avg=21ms  max=22ms
```

---

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Clone with submodule
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stachuman/meshcore_sim.git
cd meshcore_sim

# 2. Build the C++ node agent
cd node_agent
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cd ..

# 3. Run a simulation
python3 -m orchestrator topologies/linear_three.json --duration 30 --seed 42

# 4. Run with the visual workbench (requires: pip install nicegui)
python3 -m workbench topologies/boston_relays.json
```

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| C++17 compiler | GCC 12+ or AppleClang 17+ | For `node_agent` |
| CMake | >= 3.16 | |
| OpenSSL | 3.x | Usually pre-installed on Linux |
| Python | 3.9+ | Orchestrator uses only stdlib |

Optional: `pip install -r requirements.txt` for the workbench (NiceGUI) and
the legacy Dash visualiser.

If cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, initialise MeshCore with:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

## How the simulation works

Each node is a separate OS process running the `node_agent` binary, which
links directly against the unmodified MeshCore C++ source.  Thin shims
replace the hardware radio, clock, and RNG with simulation-friendly versions:

- **SimRadio** — `recvRaw()` pops from a queue fed by the orchestrator;
  `startSendRaw()` emits JSON to stdout; `isSendComplete()` waits for the
  real LoRa airtime to elapse (Semtech AN1200.13 formula).
- **SimNode** — inherits `BaseChatMesh`, running real MeshCore ACK tracking,
  retry logic, contact management, path exchange, and duty-cycle enforcement.
- **SimClock** — wall-clock backed millisecond + RTC clocks.
- **SimRNG** — deterministic xoshiro256** PRNG seeded per node.

The Python orchestrator acts as the physical world:

1. Delivers packets between nodes based on the topology graph.
2. Applies per-link loss, propagation delay, and adversarial filters.
3. Computes LoRa airtime and delays delivery until TX completes.
4. Detects RF collisions (overlapping TX windows at shared receivers).
5. Enforces half-duplex (drops packets arriving at a transmitting node).
6. Applies the LoRa capture effect when lat/lon positions are available.
7. Generates traffic (advertisement floods + Poisson random text messages + public group channel messages).
8. Collects metrics: delivery rate, latency, collisions, ACK outcomes,
   per-packet path traces, and privacy exposure (witness counts).

For the full technical reference, see **[SIMULATION.md](SIMULATION.md)**.

## Running simulations

### Command line

```sh
python3 -m orchestrator <topology.json> [options]
```

Key options:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--duration SECS` | Traffic duration (on top of warmup) |
| `--warmup SECS` | Time before traffic starts (auto-derived if omitted) |
| `--traffic-interval SECS` | Mean seconds between random text sends |
| `--seed N` | RNG seed for reproducibility |
| `--trace-out FILE` | Write packet trace JSON (for workbench) |
| `--agent PATH` | Override node binary (e.g. `privatemesh/build/privatemesh_agent`) |
| `--log-level` | `debug` / `info` / `warning` / `error` |

See **[EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)** for worked scenarios with expected output.

### Visual workbench

The NiceGUI workbench provides topology editing, simulation launch, and
interactive trace replay in a browser.

```sh
pip install nicegui                                          # one-time
python3 -m workbench topologies/boston_relays.json            # opens browser
python3 -m workbench topologies/boston_relays.json --port 8090
```

Features:
- Map-based topology viewer (OpenStreetMap) with node/edge detail panels.
- Interactive topology editor (add/remove/move nodes and edges).
- One-click simulation launch with live log streaming.
- Packet trace replay with step-through, play/pause, and broadcast animation.
- Clickable cross-references between packets, nodes, and edges.

## What changed vs upstream

This fork diverges from the
[original simulator](https://github.com/matthewdgreen/meshcore_sim) in
several significant ways.  The original was designed for deterministic,
fast simulation by skipping radio timing and randomness.  This fork restores
those mechanisms to model real MeshCore behaviour.

### SimNode inherits BaseChatMesh (not just Mesh)

The original `SimNode` reimplemented ACK tracking, retry logic, and contact
management in Python.  This fork makes `SimNode` inherit from MeshCore's
`BaseChatMesh` class, so the **real C++ code** runs for:

- ACK tracking and CRC matching (`processAck()`)
- Message retry (up to 3 attempts via `onSendTimeout()`)
- Flood/direct timeout calculation (`calcFloodTimeoutMillisFor()`)
- Contact management (32-slot array with ECDH shared secrets)
- Path exchange (flood out, direct back)
- Duty-cycle enforcement (Dispatcher token-bucket)

### Real radio timing

`SimRadio::isSendComplete()` blocks for the actual LoRa airtime computed
from SF, BW, CR, and payload length (Semtech AN1200.13).  This enables:

- Realistic Dispatcher duty-cycle enforcement.
- Real retransmit delay jitter (`getRetransmitDelay()` runs unmodified).
- Correct `packetScore()` using SF-dependent SNR thresholds (matching
  `RadioLibWrapper::packetScoreInt()` from MeshCore).

### RF collision model

The orchestrator tracks all active TX windows and detects collisions:

- **Temporal overlap** — two transmissions whose airtime windows overlap.
- **Spatial reachability** — the interferer must be a radio neighbour of
  the receiver.
- **Capture effect** — when lat/lon positions are available, a signal that
  is >= 6 dB stronger than the interferer survives (log-distance path loss).
- **Half-duplex enforcement** — packets arriving at a node that is currently
  transmitting are dropped by the orchestrator before reaching the node.

### Deterministic per-node PRNG

`SimRNG` uses xoshiro256** seeded from the node's name or private key,
ensuring unique but reproducible identities.  The original seeded all nodes
identically when no private key was provided, causing identity collisions.

### Radio parameters threaded end-to-end

The topology JSON `radio` section (SF, BW, CR) is passed to each node agent
via CLI flags, so both the C++ airtime formula and the Python orchestrator
use consistent parameters.

### Additional fixes

- **ODR violation** in SimNode.h include path (commit `aeb60a0`).
- **Airtime formula** replaced: old formula (`len * 125ms`) gave wildly
  wrong results (5000 ms for 40 bytes); now uses Semtech AN1200.13 (~443 ms
  at EU Narrow for 40 bytes).

python3 -m sim_tests sim_tests.test_config   # single module

## Generating grid topologies

```sh

```

Corner nodes are endpoints; all others are relays.  Useful for controlled
multi-hop routing experiments.
